An application with suitable UI to generate the CFG from a given program file. On editing of the program file the CFG should also modify accordingly. The UI should also show the basic characteristics (like, no. of nodes, no. of edges, predicate nodes, no. of bounded region, no. of paths. Etc.) of the CFG
