# Control Flow Graph

An application with suitable UI to generate the CFG from a given program file. On editing of the program file the CFG should also modify accordingly. The UI should also show the basic characteristics (like, no. of nodes, no. of edges, predicate nodes, no. of bounded region, no. of paths. Etc.) of the CFG 

Note:- Use of any conditional or loop statements in input should be strictly specified by opening and closing paranthesis.
